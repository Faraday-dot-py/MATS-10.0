Artificial Intelligence is a technology that has only stepped onto the main stage of everyday people's lives, and it's primarily because of LLMs. It's been influencing their everyday lives for a long time before the release of GPT-3, but the underlying technology hasn't been the main topic of conversation. Now that generative AI has taken the world by storm, many other alternate areas of AI research have been shelved in favor of the technology everyone's been talking about - and investing in, resulting in the stagnation of other fields that could significantly benefit from new AI research.

I wanted this paragraph to speak to my other concern: a societal shift away from AI due to a fear imposed by its misuse. Similar to how Nuclear energy is unequally feared compared to its benefits due to misunderstandings about its dangers (largely because of mishandling of the technology), I don't want the word AI to be feared and shunned because someone decided to rewrite the truth. We are on a path toward mutually assured deception, and my choices reflect how I feel I'll be able to help steer humanity away from that future.
